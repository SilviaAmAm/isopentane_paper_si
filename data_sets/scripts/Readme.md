# Data set scripts

This folder contains some utility scripts related to the data sets:

1. `prune_md_structures.py`
2. `hdf5_to_xyz.py        `

## 1. Pruning MD trajectories

The `prune_md_structures.py` script shows the pruning strategy used to find structures in the MD dataset, that had been broken apart somehow. This has already been used on the given MD data set.

## 2. Converting HDF5 to xyz-formatted files.

The `hdf5_to_xyz.py` script converts the data contained in the h5-file into xyz files for easier visualization.
